# FREQ-Seq

FREQ-Seq is a high-throughput methodology for allele frequency detection in natural and laboratory populations to allow a better understanding of evolutionary processes. The method is based on Illumina-based allel frequency sequencing, where they determine the allele frequency by counting DNA seqeunce reads at diffent time points. A high coverage of the genom is necessary to sufficient detect alleles at a low ferquency and to achieve any statistical accuracy. FREQ-Seq was used to analyse the frequency of known alleles in a laboratory evolution experiment.
It is expected that the method can be applied in other diagnostic applications and phylogenetic analyses.
