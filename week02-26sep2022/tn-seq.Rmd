#Tn-seq

## Authors: fphili, yael261, pewende

## Desciption

Tn-seq stands for transposon insertion sequencing. Transposons are DNA segments that can relocate within the genome. The insertion of a transposon will affect the function of a gene it has relocated to. By sequencing the genome to locate the transposon insertion site the affected function can be linked to a gene of interest. 

## Application
Comparison of fitness between mutants and wild-type of gene of interest.


## Statistics
Two sample t-test with Bonferroni correction.
