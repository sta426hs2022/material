Analysis of open vs closed chromatin regions to look into regulation. 

## Sequencing mechanism

* The sequencing method will sequence the DNA-protein complex after the treatment of DNase I. Then the sequencing results reflect the DNA clips where the regulatory protein is located. 
* The specific methods for sequencing the isolated trimmed complex is deep sequencing.

### Method
1. Cells are lysed to release nuclei which are digested with DNase I;
2. DNase I digested DNA fragments are blunt-ended, extracted and ligated;
3. DNAs are amplified by PCR and sequenced by Illumina/Solexa.

## Statistical Methods for analysis

* One common model to identifies protein-binding footprints from digital footprinting data using DNAse sequencing is the **dynamic Bayesian network**. It detects candidate footprints as regions of depleted cleavage relative to a local background and assigns a statistical confidence estimate to each candidate based on an empirical null model. 
* Another common statistical model incorporates DNase-seq data and PWMs within a **multivariate hidden Markov model** (HMM) to detect footprint-like regions with matching motifs
* Kernel density estimation

## Applications

* DNAse sequencing is a highly efficient tool to detect the active gene regulatory elements that governs various biological processes, specially for DNase 
hypersensitive (HS) sites. 
* Comparing to the traditional way of Southern blot, the method is more efficienty by capturing DNase-digested fragments and high-throughput sequencing.
