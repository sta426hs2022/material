# MERFISH (multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization)
***
Basic Idea: To quantify mRNA transcript spatially inside fixated cells (in situ) by hybridization of the mRNA with labeled complementary RNA probes. ([Source](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-022-01075-1))

## What does the method:

- Like most of the current ISH methods, it does multiple rounds of hybridization of the mRNA with a complementary probe which will then be fluorescence labeled and can be imaged. ([Source](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2892))  

- In each hybridization round different probes bind to the mRNA, with the sequence of images can than the sequence of the mRNA reconstructed. ([Source](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-022-01075-1))

- In comparison to seqFISH it uses not direct fluorescence probes but the probes contains sites for binary encoded secondary probes ([Source](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa6090))


## Difference of seqFISH(A) and MERFISH(B):

## What is the benefit from MERFISH over seqFISH:

In seq-FISH with each round of hybridization the risk for an error grows exponentially for each individual target mRNA. An error in MERFISH can easier be corrected as if you encounter an unexpected sequence with the binary approach the problem is less complex than wih four different fluorphores.
