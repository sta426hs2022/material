## Mapping in practice

Check the online available manuals for the mappers

* bowtie2  
* STAR  

and answer the questions

* How do these mappers score alignments?  
* What reporting options are available?  


## Mapping with R

Use the Rsubread package to map a read file found at http://fgcz-gstore.uzh.ch/public/Yeast_Reads/


```{r, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("Rsubread", update=FALSE)
BiocManager::install("BSgenome.Scerevisiae.UCSC.sacCer3", update=FALSE)

# download the a read data file
dir.create("~/Yeast_example")
setwd("~/Yeast_example")
download.file("http://fgcz-gstore.uzh.ch/public/Yeast_Reads/20170313.A-G1_R1-sub.fastq.gz", "G1_R1-sub.fastq.gz")


```



```{r, message=FALSE ,eval=FALSE}
library("BSgenome")
library("BSgenome.Scerevisiae.UCSC.sacCer3")
library("Rsubread")
```

Use the commands *export* to export method in the *BSgenome* package to write the genome as a fasta file on the local disk. Use the commands *buildindex* and *align* of the *Rsubread* package to map the reads. Consult the help pages of the respective functions. Build the index so that at most 2GB of RAM is used. Run the alignment with 4 threads. If you computer has less resources, adapt accordingly.

What is the mapping rate of the reads? How does the mapping rate change if you trim 5 bases of both ends?
